- 🎯 We aim in this project to `analyze the sentiment of tweets` provided from the Sentiment140 dataset by `developing a machine learning sentiment analysis model` involving the use of classifiers. The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using accuracy and F1 scores to choose the best model for the dataset used.
