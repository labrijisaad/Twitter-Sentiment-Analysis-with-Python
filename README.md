# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python 🐍 and NLP 📙

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

Welcome to the **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** project! 🌟 Here, we dive into the captivating realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze tweet sentiments using mighty machine learning techniques.

## 📊 **Dataset**

Access the dataset here: [Sentiment140 Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19IeqXU96-kDt6wy1wTNyhWrIw1jbK2Kx/view?usp=sharing). 📂

## 🛠️ **Methodology**

We wield the power of classifiers to craft an effective sentiment analysis model, evaluating their prowess with accuracy and F1 scores. 🔍

## **Getting Started 🏁**

Follow these simple steps to set up and start working on the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/labrijisaad/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python
   ```
   
3. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that you have Python 3.9 installed. You can find the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended for project isolation):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
   
5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

6. **Install Dependencies** from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Download the Dataset**:
   Download the dataset from [Sentiment140 Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19IeqXU96-kDt6wy1wTNyhWrIw1jbK2Kx/view?usp=sharing) and place the CSV file in a newly created `data` directory within the project.

8. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
